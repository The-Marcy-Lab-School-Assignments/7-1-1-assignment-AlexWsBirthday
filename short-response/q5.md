# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
`/products/5` will match the `/products/:id` path since after the products path, an id number is provided. Whereas the rest include less, more, or completely different (but related) information that change the path to a different source of data.
