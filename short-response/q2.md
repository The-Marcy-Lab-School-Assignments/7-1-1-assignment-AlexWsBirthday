# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer
First, what is an SPA? What is an MPA?
---
* SPA - single page application, which depenidng on user imput, fetches data and loads different components onto the same page. This makes it so you do not have to render multiple pages.

SPAs are better because:
* they load faster since they're lighter
* Server load is also lighter bc again, not hosting multiple pages just components. Data can be outsourced to third parties
* Pages don't have to reload 

---

* MPA - Multiple page application, which switch between pages depending on user input. 

MPAs have pros, too: 
* Better for SEO
* Better for larger apps 
* tend to be friendlier with most browsers (compatibility)
